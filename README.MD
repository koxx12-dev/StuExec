A Gui for roblox studio execution dll [RbxStu](https://github.com/RbxStu/RbxStu-V2)\
This codebase is a mess since it's my first wpf project, don't look at it if you don't want to get a headache.<br/>
If you find any bugs, please report them in the issues tab.

### Warning
It might be detected by some antiviruses, this is because it includes and uses a dll injector to inject RbxStu dll into roblox studio process. <br/>
If you don't trust the release, you can compile the source code yourself. (unless I messed something up)
